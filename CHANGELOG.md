 * Bugfix #138: Add missing value for consumption metrics

   Until now the value for the consumption metrics was missing any assignment of a
   real value as the variable have only been defined with the default zero value.
   Beside that you are also able to add a currency label to make sure you can
   calculate correct currencies.

 * Change #53: Integrate standard web config

   We integrated the new web config from the Prometheus toolkit which provides a

 * Enhancement #53: Integrate option pprof profiling

   We have added an option to enable a pprof endpoint for proper profiling support
   with the help of tools like Parca. The endpoint `/debug/pprof` can now
   optionally be enabled to get the profiling details for catching potential memory
   leaks.
